## Random observations

- I'm spending quite a lot of time on awesome details, but the game is not Alive yet
- I tried implementing Immer, which was actually quite fun and revealed some referencing bugs in my code. However the performance dropped significantly, actually unplayable, didn't even bother to measure. Auf Nimmerwiedersehen!
